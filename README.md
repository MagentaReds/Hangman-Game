# Hangman-Game

I haven't fully divorced the hangman object from the DOM interaction.  If I have time, I'll go back and redo the hangman object to be purely about the game code, and then I'll have a helper object hangman displayer/interactor that implements the hangman game into my webpage.

Idea is, people can take the hangman game object, then right their own displayer for the webpage they want.
